Devel-Cycle version 1.00
========================

This module can be used to find memory cycles in objects and other
references.  Here is the synopsis:

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use Devel::Cycle;

  # create an object that has four cycles
  my $test = {fred   => [qw(a b c d e)],
	    ethel  => [qw(1 2 3 4 5)],
	    george => {martha => 23,
		       agnes  => 19}
	   };
  # cycle 1
  $test->{george}{phyllis} = $test;
  # cycle 2
  $test->{fred}[3]      = $test->{george};
  # cycles 3 and 4
  $test->{george}{mary} = $test->{fred};
  find_cycle($test);
  exit 0;

  # output of the script:

 Cycle (1):
 	HASH(0x8171d30)->{george} => HASH(0x8171d00)
	HASH(0x8171d00)->{phyllis} => HASH(0x8171d30)

 Cycle (2):
	HASH(0x8171d30)->{george} => HASH(0x8171d00)
	HASH(0x8171d00)->{mary} => ARRAY(0x814be60)
	ARRAY(0x814be60)->[3] => HASH(0x8171d00)

 Cycle (3):
	HASH(0x8171d30)->{fred} => ARRAY(0x814be60)
	ARRAY(0x814be60)->[3] => HASH(0x8171d00)
	HASH(0x8171d00)->{phyllis} => HASH(0x8171d30)

 Cycle (4):
	HASH(0x8171d30)->{fred} => ARRAY(0x814be60)
	ARRAY(0x814be60)->[3] => HASH(0x8171d00)
	HASH(0x8171d00)->{mary} => ARRAY(0x814be60)

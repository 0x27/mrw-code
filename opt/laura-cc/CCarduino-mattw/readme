Plug the hardware together, inc mains power for the lights, and USB connection for the Arduino.

At this point, the relays should click in sync at a steady rate. When the lights are mains-powered, the lights will switch on and off, all together, at the same rate.

Unzip the CCarduino.zip file on to the laptop/PC to which the Arduino is connected.


Customising and starting the perl app that subscribes to the Current Cost data and passes it to the Arduino
==================================

Go into the CCarduino directory and open the CCarduino.pl file in a text editor.

At the top of the file, change the left and right topic names so that they are topics on which Current Cost data gets published.

L_Reading = Green
R_Reading = Red

Also edit the serial port name if you know it to be different.

From a terminal, start the CCarduino.pl script by running the CCarduino.sh script (the .sh script calls the .pl script).

The terminal displays the readings that are being received.

You should be able to see the lights flash faster as the numbers go up. That is, the more electricity being used, the faster the lights flash.

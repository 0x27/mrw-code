                   Collection of Arduino Libraries
                   ===============================


* The content of the `libraries' directory

The libraries directory contains various utility libraries that are
used in the Arduino projects.  This section describes the original
sources of those libraries.  I (mtr@iki.fi) have modified some of the
libraries (i.e. removed unused source files from the original library
contents) to optimize the system SRAM usage and to make the libraries
fit nicely into my projects.  In case you miss something, you should
check the original library locations from the originating URL
locations below.

Much of the code was inspired by Derek Yerger's code, though I don't
think much of that remains.  In any event that was..

The CRC code was excerpted and inspired by the Dallas Semiconductor
sample code bearing this copyright.
